# GPU MD5 Cracker 

A high-performance, GPU-accelerated MD5 hash cracker built using CUDA.  
This project is part of our final course project for **ECE 759: High-Performance Computing (Spring 2025)** at UWâ€“Madison.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement a parallelized MD5 hash attack using **CUDA** to efficiently brute-force 7-character alphanumeric passwords. The project showcases how modern GPUs can drastically accelerate hash computation through parallelism.
